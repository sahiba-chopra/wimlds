Welcome! This is a notebook that runs through Logistic Regression & Random Forest models to decide whether someone is creditable or not. 

I presented this notebook at the Women in Machine Learning and Data Science inaugural event in Mumbai on Sep 16, 2018 at KJ Somaiya College, Mumbai. I've added resources at the end of the notebook to help readers understand the functions & models used. 

Hope you enjoy it!

And thanks WiMLDS for the opportunity to speak at your event :)
